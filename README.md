# Portfolio
## To employers
I intend to provide examples of some of my previous work with this repository. You'll primarily find projects that I did in Python and C++. 
### Absence of HabitForge
You may have noticed that the codespace for HabitForge is missing. This is because HabitForge is a for-profit app and the confidentiality of its codebase is imperative. However, I will provide some details about the app. I built the app using the Flutter SDK and I used Firebase as a backend. I also used RevenueCat to manage subscriptions.
